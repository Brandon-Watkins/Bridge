# bridge
A Bridge card game for CS 4488

Functions and classes that are mostly, if not solely, coded myself (Brandon Watkins) are indicated as such in the auto-doc block comments.

There is an executable (if your antivirus protection didn't automatically delete it) located at Bridge\BridgeApp\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\BridgeApp.exe.

The code is also on my GitHub repo located at https://github.com/Brandon-Watkins/Bridge, if you wanted to view the diffs.
